  kind can be one of the following:

  :auto   - Try to guess the right type of terminal based on OS, whether
            there's a windowing environment, etc
  :swing  - Force a Swing-based terminal.
  :text   - Force a console (i.e.: non-Swing) terminal.  Try to guess the
            appropriate kind of console (UNIX/Cygwin) by the OS.
  :unix   - Force a UNIX console terminal.
  :cygwin - Force a Cygwin console terminal.

  Options can contain one or more of the following keys:

  :cols    - Width of the desired terminal in characters (default 80).
  :rows    - Height of the desired terminal in characters (default 24).
  :charset - Charset of the desired terminal.  Can be any of
             (keys lanterna.constants/charsets) (default :utf-8).
  :resize-listener - A function to call when the terminal is resized.  This
                     function should take two parameters: the new number of
                     columns, and the new number of rows.

  NOTE: The options are really just a suggestion!

  The console terminal will ignore rows and columns and will be the size of the
  user's window.

  The Swing terminal will start out at this size but can be resized later by the
  user, and will ignore the charset entirely.

  God only know what Cygwin will do.
