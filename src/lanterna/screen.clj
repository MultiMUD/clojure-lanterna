  kind can be one of the following:

  :auto   - Try to guess the right type of screen based on OS, whether
            there's a windowing environment, etc
  :swing  - Force a Swing-based screen.
  :text   - Force a console (i.e.: non-Swing) screen.  Try to guess the
            appropriate kind of console (UNIX/Cygwin) by the OS.
  :unix   - Force a UNIX console screen.
  :cygwin - Force a Cygwin console screen.

  Options can contain one or more of the following keys:

  :cols    - Width of the desired screen in characters (default 80).
  :rows    - Height of the desired screen in characters (default 24).
  :charset - Charset of the desired screen.  Can be any of
             (keys lanterna.constants/charsets) (default :utf-8).
  :resize-listener - A function to call when the screen is resized.  This
                     function should take two parameters: the new number of
                     columns, and the new number of rows.
  :font      - Font to use.  String or sequence of strings.
               Use (lanterna.terminal/get-available-fonts) to see your options.
               Will fall back to a basic monospaced font if none of the given
               names are available.
  :font-size - An int of the size of the font to use.

  NOTE: The options are really just a suggestion!

  The console screen will ignore rows and columns and will be the size of the
  user's window.

  The Swing screen will start out at this size but can be resized later by the
  user, and will ignore the charset entirely.

  God only know what Cygwin will do.

(defn put-sheet
  "EXPERIMENTAL!  Turn back now!

  Draw a sheet to the screen (buffered, of course).

  A sheet is a two-dimentional sequence of things to print to the screen.  It
  will be printed with its upper-left corner at the given x and y coordinates.

  Sheets can take several forms.  The simplest sheet is a vector of strings:

    (put-sheet scr 2 0 [\"foo\" \"bar\" \"hello!\"])

  This would print something like

     0123456789
    0  foo
    1  bar
    2  hello!

  As you can see, the rows of a sheet do not need to all be the same size.
  Shorter rows will *not* be padded in any way.

  Rows can also be sequences themselves, of characters or strings:

    (put-sheet scr 5 0 [[\\s \\p \\a \\m] [\"e\" \"g\" \"g\" \"s\"]])

     0123456789
    0     spam
    1     eggs

  Finally, instead of single characters of strings, you can pass a vector of a
  [char-or-string options-map], like so:

    (put-sheet scr 1 0 [[[\\r {:fg :red}] [\\g {:fg :green}]]
                        [[\\b {:fg :blue}]]])

     0123456789
    0 rg
    1 b

  And the letters would be colored appropriately.

  Finally, you can mix and match any and all of these within a single sheet or
  row:

    (put-sheet scr 2 0 [\"foo\"
                        [\"b\" \\a [\\r {:bg :yellow :fg :black}])
