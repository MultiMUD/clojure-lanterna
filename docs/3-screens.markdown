Screens
=======

The next layer of Lanterna is the screen layer.  Think of screens as "[double
buffering][] for your console".

[double buffering]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_buffering#Double_buffering_in_computer_graphics

Screens act as a buffer.  You "draw" to the screen like you would normally draw
directly to the terminal, but it doesn't appear to the user.

When you're ready you tell the Screen to redraw.  It will calculate the
necessary changes and make them happen.

This improves performance (TODO: elaborate) and makes it easy to avoid
showing half-drawn UIs to your users.

clojure-lantera's screen API is *very* similar to the terminal one.  **If you
haven't read the [Terminal documentation](./2-terminals) you need to do that
before you read this.**  This document moves very quickly because it assumes
you've read the previous one.

Getting a Screen
----------------

Let's get started.  Open up a REPL and pull in the namespace:

    :::clojure
    (require '[lanterna.screen :as s])

Much like getting a Terminal, you get a Screen with `get-screen`:

    :::clojure
    (def scr (s/get-screen :swing))

`get-screen` supports all the same types of console as `get-terminal`.

You need to `start` and `stop` a Screen before/after use just like a Terminal:

    :::clojure
    (s/start scr)
    ; ... do things ...
    (s/stop scr)

There's an `in-screen` helper too:

    :::clojure
    (let [scr (s/get-screen :swing)]
      (in-screen scr
        ; do things with scr
        ))


Writing Text
------------

The screen layer uses a single function to draw to the screen: `put-string`.
There is no single-character function like the terminal layer has.

`put-string` works like its Terminal counterpart:

    :::clojure
    (s/put-string scr 0 0 "Hello, world!")

When you run this, nothing will happen.  This is because Screens buffer their
output.  You need to redraw the screen to see any changes:

    :::clojure
    (s/redraw scr)

![Screen](http://i.imgur.com/79Qr1.png)

You can of course queue up many updates before redrawing -- that's the whole
point of a screen!

    :::clojure
    (s/put-string scr 20 10 "Hello, world!")
    (s/put-string scr 27 10 "Steve")
    (s/redraw scr)

![Screen with More](http://i.imgur.com/tLm16.png)

This will display "Hello, Steve!", which demonstrates that you can overwrite
a single character as much as you want before a redraw and the correct result
will be shown.

Note that because we haven't touched the upper-left corner in this redraw our
original "Hello, world!" is still there.  Screens redraw *changes*, they don't
start from scratch every time.

If you want to remove old text you'll need to clear it out yourself by drawing
over it with spaces. Here's an example of printing " " across the full screen:

    :::clojure
    (let [[width height] (s/get-size scr)
          spaces         (apply str (repeat width " "))]
      (dorun (map #(s/put-string scr 0 % spaces) (range height)))
      (s/redraw scr))

### Colors

Drawing colored text works a bit differently than the Terminal layer.  Instead
of specifying a color once and then everything you draw being that color, you
specify the color in an option map alongside the string to draw:

    :::clojure
    (s/put-string scr 0 12 "Red" {:fg :red})
    (s/put-string scr 0 13 "Green" {:fg :green})
    (s/put-string scr 0 14 "Yellow" {:fg :black :bg :yellow})
    (s/redraw scr)

### Styles

Currently broken, sorry.

Moving the Cursor
-----------------

Just like the terminal layer, you might want to move the cursor when using
a Screen.

There's a `move-cursor` function that works like the terminal one to do this:

    :::clojure
    (s/put-string scr 5 5 "@")
    (s/move-cursor scr 5 5)
    (s/redraw scr)

![Screen with Cursor Moved](http://i.imgur.com/gQ2FO.png)

Notice that you have to redraw the screen before the cursor will actually move.

The cursor will stay where you put it, even after other updating and redraws:

    :::clojure
    (s/put-string scr 5 5 " ")
    (s/put-string scr 6 5 "@")
    (s/redraw scr)

![Screen with Cursor Unmoved](http://i.imgur.com/XTd1I.png)

See how the cursor is still in the original spot (5, 5)?  If you want it to move
you need to tell it to move with `move-cursor`.

Input
-----

Getting input works exactly like the terminal layer:

    :::clojure
    (s/get-key scr)
    ; => nil

    (s/get-key-blocking scr)
    ; => :page-down

    (s/get-key scr)
    ; => \S

Go back and read the terminal docs if you don't understand those functions.

Sizing
------

Sizing works the same way as the terminal layer.  Screen have a `get-size`
function of their own:

    :::clojure
    (s/get-size scr)
    ; => [130 44]

You can pass a resize listening function when you create your screen:

    :::clojure
    (def screen-size (ref [0 0]))

    (defn handle-resize [cols rows]
      (dosync (ref-set screen-size [cols rows])))

    (def scr (s/get-screen :swing {:resize-listener handle-resize}))

Go back and read the terminal docs for the full story.

What's Next?
------------

Now that you can use the screen layer for double-buffered console rendering
you've got pretty much everything you need.  Go make something!

The [Reference documentation](./4-reference) has all the detailed information
you'll probably find yourself looking for once you actually dive in and start
building.
